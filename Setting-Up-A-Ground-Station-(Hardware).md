## What You Need:

To set up a ground station to listen to KickSat and the Sprites, you need 3 things: An antenna, a low noise amplifier (LNA), and a software defined radio (SDR) interface. Below is a list of examples of hardware that should work and where to get them.

### Antennas:

* [Arrow Antenna 440-5](http://arrowantennas.com/arrowii/440-5ii.html) (This is the one to get if you're in the U.S.)

### LNAs:

* Down East Microwave L432LNA
* RFBay LNA-440
* dg0ve LNA70-1

### SDRs:
