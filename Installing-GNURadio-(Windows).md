### 1. Download and Install a 32 Bit Version of Python

I recommend the Anaconda Python distribution as it has a nice easy installer and comes with almost everything you need. Just [get it here](http://09c8d0b2229f813c1b93-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.r79.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda-1.9.1-Windows-x86.exe) and double click to install.

### 2. Download and Install PyGTK

One package that Anaconda doesn't include that GNURadio depends on is PyGTK. After installing Anaconda, download and install PyGTK from [here](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi). The default settings are fine.

### 3. Download and Install GNURadio

Now we're ready to install GNURadio. Grab the [Windows binary here](http://files.ettus.com/binaries/gnuradio/gnuradio_v3.7.2.1/gnuradio_3.7.2.1_Win32.exe) and double click.

### 4. Configure PATH

The last thing you have to do is add GNURadio's libraries to your system PATH and PYTHONPATH. Open the control panel and navigate to "System Properties". Under the "Advanced" tab, click the "Environment Variables" button. Under "System variables", click "New" and add a variable called "PYTHONPATH" with the value C:\Program Files (x86)\gnuradio\lib\site-packages.
