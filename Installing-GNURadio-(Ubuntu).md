I've written a script that should handle installing GNURadio, the RTL-SDR and Funcube drivers for the USB receiver dongles, and the Sprite receiver blocks, on a recent installation of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (or one of the many other distributions based on Ubuntu). It's been tested on fresh installs of 32 and 64 bit [Ubuntu 13.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-latest). Here's what to do:

#### 1. Download Install Script
[Grab the script here](https://raw.github.com/zacinaction/kicksat/master/GroundStation/GNURadio/Install-SpriteRadio) and save it somewhere convenient (e.g. your home folder).

#### 2. Make The Script Executable
This can be done from the terminal or the GUI. To use the GUI, right click on the file and click "Properties". At the top of the Properties window, click the "Permissions" tab, then check the box next to "Allow executing file as program".

#### 3. Run The Script
Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the script, and run it by typing `./Install-SpriteRadio`. You'll have to enter your password and you'll also need to be connected to the internet to download the necessary packages and source code. The install process should take 5-10 minutes.

#### 4. Run GRC
If everything goes well, you should now find a program called "GRC" (which stands for GNURadio Companion) in your applications menu. Download the [Sprite receiver file here](https://raw.github.com/zacinaction/kicksat/master/GroundStation/GNURadio/SpriteReceiver.grc), then open it in GRC. If you see a block diagram like the one below (with no missing blocks), that means all the necessary software has been installed.
