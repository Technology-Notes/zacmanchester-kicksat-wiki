## What You Need:

To set up a ground station to listen to KickSat and the Sprites, you need 3 things: An antenna, a low noise amplifier (LNA), and a software defined radio (SDR) interface. Below is a list of examples of hardware that should work and where to get them.

### Antennas:

* [Arrow Antenna 440-5](http://arrowantennas.com/arrowii/440-5ii.html). This is the one I have the most experience with and recommend, but any small hand-held Yagi antenna should work.

### LNAs:

* [Down East Microwave L432LNA](http://www.downeastmicrowave.com/PDF/l-lna.PDF)
* [RFBay LNA-440](http://rfbay.com/LNA/LNA-440.pdf)
* [dg0ve LNA70-1](http://www.dg0ve.de/en/lna70_en.htm)

### SDRs:

* [DVB-T USB Stick](http://www.nooelec.com/store/software-defined-radio/tv28tv2-sdr-dvb-t-usb-stick-set.html#.Uxu38uddVqs). The E4000 and R820T chipsets are best.
* [Funcube Dongle](http://funcubedongle.3dcartstores.com/FUNcube-Dongle-Pro-A20_p_27.html)

### Odds 'n Ends:

* [MCX to BNC Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Generic-Female-Right-Angle-Adapter/dp/B00EQ1UZC2/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1394326600&sr=8-16&keywords=mcx+to+bnc) to connect a DVB-T stick to an Arrow antenna.
* [SMA to BNC Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Female-Male-Plug-Coax-Adapter/dp/B002A6CWDA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1394327837&sr=8-2&keywords=sma+to+bnc) to connect the Funcube dongle to an Arrow antenna.
* [BNC Cables](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=BNC%20RG58). You'll want a couple of these. Make sure they're 50 Ohms (RG58 cable will work).

## Putting it Together:
