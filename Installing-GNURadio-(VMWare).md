If you are unable to install Ubuntu, VMWare on Windows is another option. Though performance suffers when running in a virtual machine, I've found it's good enough to record .wav files from an RTL dongle or Funcube.

### 1. Install VMWare Player

First, download and install the free [VMWare Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0).
