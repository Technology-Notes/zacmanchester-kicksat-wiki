If you are unable to install Ubuntu, VMWare on Windows is another option. Though performance suffers when running in a virtual machine, I've found it's good enough to record .wav files from an RTL dongle or Funcube.

### 1. Install VMWare Player

First, download and install the free [VMWare Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0). If you already have one of the other versions of VMWare (e.g. Workstation or Fusion) you can skip this step.

### 2. Download KickSat Virtual Machine Image

Next, download the [pre-configured KickSat VMWare image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19178351/KickSatVM.7z). Right click the link and "Save As" somewhere convenient. The image file is compressed with 7-Zip to make the download go faster. If you don't already have a program to decompress it, [download and install 7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).

Once you have the image file downloaded and 7-Zip installed, decompress the image by right clicking and selecting 7-Zip => Extract Here. This will probably take a few minutes.
